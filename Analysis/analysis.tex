\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Client Identification}
My client is Ian Vines. He works for the company Huxley Bertram which is an engineering company that focuses on designing and making machines for other companies. He is involved in designing the machines and checking which parts are available and getting the ones that aren't.
\subsection{Define the current system}
There is currently no organised system for the task provided. The current system is a text document that is not organised. All the data in the document is not in a structured form and some of the data in the document may not be updated as to update the data would require manually adjusting it.
\subsection{Describe the problems}
The company currently gets machine parts from all different companies and people and at the moment the only information they have about the companies is on the text doument. To find out what company they get a certain machine part from they have to go through all the pages to find the right one. This takes a lot of time and they need a system that can make the process a lot quicker.

\section{Investigation}

\subsection{The current system}
A text document/Notepad with the information that is needed to buy the part from the company. It usually consists of the company's name, address, email, phone number, postcode, website name, part name and part price.

\subsection{The proposed system}
The proposed system will be a database that stores all of the different company's information and which machine part they are selling. The program will allow you to add or remove companies from the database according to any new information you receive. It will also allow you to edit the information stored in the data base allowing you to update any changes that may have happened. You will also be allowed to search key words such as a company's name or the specific part you need. The program will then show all the appropriate companies with the part you need,the price and the company's contact information. The program will also show the comments of other employees on what they thought of the product and if it suited their needs.

\subsubsection{Volumetrics}
The system should be able to store 200 company's information along with the part and price. It should allow for expansion to allow more information to be stored.

\section{Other Abstractions and Graphs}

\section{Constraints}

\subsection{Hardware}
The hardware available is the basic computer hardware. This includes: A mouse, A keyboard, A monitor, A computer, Speakers. Anything else is not available as not every employee has the hardware.

\subsection{Software}
The software available must be down loadable (if needed) and must be available to Windows 7,8 and 10.
\subsection{Time}
The deadline is april
\subsection{User Knowledge}
The system must be simple and easy to use by someone who is not familiar with all the functions on a computer. It must have a layout that is easy to access the information and has everything that is needed within one window. There shouldn't be multiple windows open.
\subsection{Access restrictions}
Every employee should be allowed to use the software so there are no access restrictions.

\section{Limitations}

\subsection{Areas considered for future computerisation}

\section{Solutions}

\subsection{Alternative solutions}
\bf \underline{Spreadsheet}
\\
\bf {Advantages}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Can hold all of the information about each company and each part
	\item Can be stored as a table
	\item Can add/remove data
\end{itemize}
\bf {Disadvantages}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Can't search for a specific part
	\item Not easy to find information
	\item Will not prioritize parts according to review left by other employees
	\item May need specific program downloaded
\end{itemize}
\bf \underline{Database}
\\
\bf {Advantages}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Can hold all of the information about each company and each part
	\item Can be searched for specific items
	\item Can filter searches to user specifications 
	\item Can add/remove data
	\item Can hold a wide range of data
\end{itemize}
\bf {Disadvantages}
\begin{itemize}
	\item May need specific program downloaded
	\item Limited to interface
	\item Limited to features included
\bf \underline{Writing a Program}
\\
\bf {Advantages}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Can Include a database if needed
	\item Can Customize to include a whole range of features
	\item Can Filter searches to user specifications 
	\item Can Add/remove data
	\item Can Create a simple and easy to use interface
\end{itemize}
\bf {Disadvantages}
\begin{itemize}
	\item May need specific program downloaded
	\item Can take time to write
	\item Can contain lots of errors if done incorrectly
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Justification of chosen solution}
The chosen solution will be writing a program as it allows for the biggest range of customization  to suit to the users needs. Although a program can contain a lot of errors if done incorrectly, the errors can be easy to fix. The only problem with writing a program is that it could take more time then perhaps other alternative, but the overall quality of the program compared to the other options in the end will be better suited to the client. The program will also include a database to store the information as i feel that it is the best way to store the information as spreadsheets  can be hard to read if you have a load of data to use.
