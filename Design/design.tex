\section{Overall System Design}

\subsection{Short description of the main parts of the system}
\textbf{Main Menu}\\
This will consist of a search bar button, an exit button, an add company button and a delete company button.\\
\textbf{Results Page}\\
This will consist of all of the relevant results to the item searched, the search bar in the top right of the window, an Edit information button, an Add information button and a Delete information button.\\
\textbf{Company Information Page}\\
This page will consist of all of the information about the specific company selected. It will show each of the suppliers phone number, owners name, email address, part provided, part price, address and website.\\
\textbf{Comments Section}\\
This page will consist of all the comments other employees have left. It will also have an "add comment" button that allows employees to add new comments.\\

\section{Hardware Specification}

A computer - desktop or laptop - no specific requirements, must be able to run simple programs\\
A monitor - that shows the program working\\
A keyboard - to be able to use the program\\
A mouse - to be able to use the program\\

\section{Program Structure}
 The main menu will be able to exit the program via a push button. Alternatively it will be able to move to the results page if an item is searched for and is valid. On the results page, the user will be able to add a new supplier into the database via a push button which will take them to the page where they enter the information of the new supplier. Once entered, it will take the user back to the results page. The results page will also allow the user to edit a supplier's information where it will take them to a separate window where they can edit the information already present, or delete the whole data. Once the user is happy with their changes, the program will go back to the results page. The results page will also be able to go back to the main menu if required. Once a supplier has been selected on the results page it will take the user to a new window where the relevent information will be shown. Here they can go back to the results page or click comments to be able to view the comments. On the comments page the user will be able to add a comment or edit/delete comments already made. They will also be able to go back to the information page.

\section{Definition of Data Requirements}


\subsection{Identification of all data input items}
Company Name\\
Company Address\\
Company Telephone Number\\
Company Owner's Name\\
Company's Website\\
Part Provided\\
Part Price\\
Comment\\
Rating
\subsection{Identification of all data output items}
Company Name\\
Company Address\\
Company Telephone Number\\
Company Owner's Name\\
Company's Website\\
Part Provided\\
Part Price\\
Comment\\
Rating
\subsection{Explanation of how data output items are generated}
All the data outputted will be data that has been entered by someone at some point in the past. Items such as comments will be typed in by the user and then added to the database. This data can then be retrieved from the database and viewed when someone proceeds onto the comments window. The information about the supplier will come from the user as well and used in the same way.

\subsection{Data Dictionary}

\\
\hline
\ CompanyName & String & Unlimited & Make sure the data is a string and not any other data type & The Name Company\\ 
\hline
\ CompanyAddress & String and Integer & 0 to 26 characters & Maximum of 26 characters, Information is actually there and it is a string with integers & Example Address\\
\hline
\ CompanyPhone Number & Integer & 11 integers & Make sure the input is not blank and is correct data type & 01234 567890\\
\hline
\ CompanyEmail & String & Unlimited characters & No blank input. Data is correct data type & 123@example.com\\
\hline
\ CompanyWebsite & String & Unlimited characters & No blank input. Data is correct data type & www.example.com\\
\hline
\ PartPrice & float & Unlimited characters & No blank input. Data is correct data type & Â£9.99\\
\hline
\ PartName & String & Unlimited characters & No blank input. Data is correct data type & Screw\\
\hline
\ Comment & String & 200 Characters & No blank input & The Example was good!\\
\hline
\ Rating & Integer & 2 Characters & No Blank input. Data is an integer & 9\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\subsection{Identification of appropriate storage media}
Hard Disk Drive or Solid State Drive. This is because both can store large amounts of data so space wouldn't need to be a problem. Also either one of them are generally built into a computer system so there would be no need to purchase any more unless storage space was too small. The storage space required from the program means that if some are needed, the ones that would have to be purchased are reletively cheap to buy. Both are also very easy to use with a computer and both can be external or internal.

\section{Security and Integrity of the System and Data}

\subsection{Security and Integrity of Data}
The system will have no encryption or security as all of the data stored is available to the public anyway either via the internet or advertisements. Therefore there is no need for security as non of the information is private or confidential.

\section{Validation}
Most of the data entered will be strings so not much validation is needed. However for data items such as emails and telephone numbers will need a validation as they are unique. For example, an email entered will have to be checked to see if there is an @ and a . within the string entered.
